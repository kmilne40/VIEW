# VIEW
VIEW is a very simple REXX script for TSO in z/OS and MVS on Hercules.  I wrote it as, being an MS-DOS and Linux person I don't always want to have to go into ISPF to simply look at a file. 
To copy it across I would recommend using the file transfer utility in whatever client you are using. I usually use x3270.

Running the file is simple - on Hercules (example) RX 'IBMUSER.VIEW' 'EXAMPLE.TEXT' and on z/OS EX 'IBMUSER.VIEW' 'EXAMPLE.TEXT' 
Feel free of course to shift it to one of your exec libraries such as SYS2.EXEC on Hercules MVS.  

Also feel free to do what you want with it, and to definitely make it better. Also, yep, I know there are likely loads out there that do the same on the CBTTAPE.ORG, but hey, I am pretty new to this.
